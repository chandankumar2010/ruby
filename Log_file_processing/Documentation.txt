Cron job: Used to schedule scripts on Unix-based OSes

#to get list of user name from terminal
grep naughty_user syslog

#to get the count of the user name, here 'l' flag count line instead of words
grep naughty_user syslog | wc -l

#grep command with regexp
grep CRON syslog | grep -oE '\((.+)\)$'

# -o : means we want to print only the matching part of the line on the screen
# -E : means we want to use extended regexp

#to run ruby code directly from command line, we use -e flag
ruby -e 'puts "This is from command line"'

# -n : This flag tells ruby that we want to apply our code to each line of the STDIN until there's no more

#ruby stores output in a global variable: $_

#log processing with hash
cat syslog.log | ruby -ne 'usernames = Hash.new(0); if $_.include?("CRON") then username = /\((.+)\)$/.match($_); usernames[username[1]]+=1 end ;puts usernames '

#system command to capitalize every word on a file
cat story.txt | ruby -ne 'puts $_.gsub(/\S+/,&:capitalize)'

#log processing without hash
cat syslog.log | ruby -ne 'if $_.include?("CRON") then username = /\((.+)\)$/.match($_); puts username.captures end'
